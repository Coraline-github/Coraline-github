# 👋 Hey, I’m Carolina — Scientist at heart, Problem Solver by trade 🔍⚙️

Welcome to my digital lab 🧬  — where curiosity meets real-world impact.
I’m a curious builder with one foot in science and the other in code.
By day, I solve problems with logic. By night, I experiment with ideas that (sometimes) work.  

I’m driven by a simple question:  
**How can we use data and thoughtful systems to make real world impact?**

If you're here, you're probably a potential collaborator, employer, or fellow knowledge explorer. Welcome.

## 🔬 About Me

- 🧠 Background: Science lover turned programmer (still in love with both), with a strong bias for action and continuous learning
- 🔍 Interests: Data analysis, automation, optimization, and making weird tools that work beautifully
- 💼 Focus: Data-driven problem solving in **consulting, operations**, and **process optimization**
- 🧰 Projects rooted in reality — tools, notebooks, and solutions aimed at **efficiency and insight**
- 💡 Believer in sustainable change: I love helping teams make better decisions using models, data, and logic
- 🎯 Mission: Bridge the gap between analysis and action

## 🧪 Projects with Purpose

> Real-world problems, scientific thinking, and business impact

### 🥚 [ProdOpt-LP](https://github.com/coraline-github/ProdOpt-LP)
**Production Optimization via Linear Programming**  
A foundational LP model that determines the optimal product mix in a small manufacturing plant. It maximizes total production within machine capacity constraints — a first step toward data-driven industrial decision-making.

### 🐣 [SchedOpt-MIP](https://github.com/coraline-github/SchedOpt-MIP)
**Optimized Scheduling with Mixed-Integer Programming**  
Builds on ProdOpt-LP to generate a fully sequenced schedule across machines, minimizing makespan and respecting setup times. Showcases advanced constraint modeling and visualizes results via Gantt charts.

### 🐥 [SimuFlow-Opt](https://github.com/coraline-github/SimuFlow-Opt)
**Simulating Optimized Flow under Uncertainty**  
Introduces real-world stochasticity using discrete-event simulation. Stress-tests the MIP-generated schedule to identify bottlenecks, evaluate robustness, and guide strategic improvements in manufacturing systems.

### ⚡ [SOLAR-PAMPA](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SOLAR-PAMPA)
**Solar Output Forecasting for La Pampa, Argentina**  
A data-driven model to forecast weekly solar energy generation using meteorological data (irradiance, cloud cover, etc.). Designed to support grid integration and energy planning in semi-arid regions. Combines physics-informed features with time series modeling for real-world impact in Argentina's renewable energy transition.

### 🏭 [PM-PIE](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PM-PIE)
**Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment**  
A machine learning–driven system to predict equipment failures using multivariate sensor data (vibration, temperature, pressure, etc.). Combines physics-informed features with time-series analysis to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and detect early signs of degradation, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime.

### 📈 [STRATEGY-I](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/STRATEGY-I)
**Stock Trading & Risk Analysis for the Young Investor**  
A backtesting framework for a simple long-term investment strategy based on technical indicators (e.g., SMA). Simulates rule-based trades on historical stock data, analyzes returns and risk (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown), and offers beginner-friendly insights into algorithmic investing.
